- Recording Rules
- Alerting Rules

**Recording Rules**:
- `Purpose`: Recording Rules are used to create new time series or modify existing time series in Prometheus.
- `Usage`: They are typically used for precomputing or aggregating data to improve query performance and simplify query expressions.
- `Example`: You can use a recording rule to calculate the average response time of your web application over a specific time window and expose it as a new metric.
- `Execution`: Recording rules are continuously evaluated by Prometheus and their results are stored as new time series data, which can be queried like regular metrics.

**Alerting Rules**:
- `Purpose`: Alerting Rules are used to define conditions under which Prometheus should generate alerts based on your metric data.
- `Usage`: They are essential for setting up alerting and monitoring in Prometheus, allowing you to detect and respond to abnormal conditions in your systems.
- `Example`: You can create an alerting rule that triggers an alert when the CPU usage exceeds a certain threshold for a specific duration.
- `Execution`: Alerting rules are continuously evaluated by Prometheus, and when a rule's condition is met, an alert is generated and can be sent to alerting systems like Alertmanager for notification.

In summary, Recording Rules are for transforming and aggregating metrics for query optimization, while Alerting Rules are for defining conditions to trigger alerts when specific criteria are met, enabling you to proactively respond to issues in your monitored systems.
